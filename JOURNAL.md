# First journal!

So originally I was planning on doing a hackpad when i started this project but ended up going down a rabbit hole so its more like a numhackpad instead of a hackpad, it also uses a matrix now too, so yea. I made the schematic and routed and wired and stuff today! (this is literally my first hardware project please help i think im overstepping it </3)
but yea, not a hackpad anymore, its a numhackpad, should update the repo name but aaa im too lazy
